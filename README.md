## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

- **Software engineering** is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing, and maintaining software.
- **Reliability** - Ensures software performs as expected without bias, especially for critical applications like healthcare and finance.
- **Efficiency** - Helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high-quality standards.
- **Scalability and flexibility** - Ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
- **Security** - Implements protection practices like authentication, authorization, and encryption to secure users' information.

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering

- **Mastering complexity** - Development of structured programming and modular design to handle increasing complexity.
- **Mastering process** - Introduction of formal methodologies and frameworks like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- **Mastering machine** - Leveraging advanced tools, compilers, and integrated development environments (IDEs) to interact efficiently with hardware.

### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle

- **Planning** - Identify the software requirements, purpose, and scope.
- **Requirement analysis** - Identify the final user specification and business needs.
- **Design** - Build the system architecture and framework.
- **Coding** - Convert the software design into tangible, functional code.
- **Testing** - Examine the software for any bugs, glitches, and performance issues.
- **Deployment** - Release the software for end-user access and use.
- **Maintenance** - Regularly update and improve the software based on feedback and emerging needs.

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies

- **Waterfall methodology**

  - Linear and sequential; each phase is completed before moving on.
  - Low flexibility; changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
  - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is fully developed.
  - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
  - **Example:** Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, like building a payroll system.

- **Agile methodology**

  - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).
  - High flexibility; adapts to changing requirements.
  - Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
  - Continuous testing after each iteration.
  - **Example:** Ideal for dynamic projects like developing a mobile application with evolving features.

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team

- **Software Developer**

  - Develop applications, programs, and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
  - Maintain and update software to ensure ongoing functionality.
  - Collaborate with other team members to ensure best practices.
  - Report progress to the project manager.

- **Quality Assurance Engineer**

  - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
  - Create development standards and procedures for programmers to follow.
  - Ensure the software meets requirements before deployment.
  - Identify bugs and suggest changes to improve efficiency.
  - Develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools.

- **Project Manager**

  - Assemble and lead the software development team.
  - Discuss project requirements with clients and developers.
  - Create a blueprint and timeline for the project.
  - Track and communicate project milestones.
  - Deliver the complete software and monitor its performance post-launch.

### Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process

- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**

  - Platforms like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that provide a space to write, compile, and debug code.
  - Ensure proper syntax and offer intelligent features for automatic code completion and suggestions.
  - Enhance readability and provide instant feedback on syntax errors.
  - Automate routine coding tasks and enable efficient debugging.

- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**

  - Tools like Git that manage changes to source code over time.
  - Enable collaboration among multiple developers without code conflicts.
  - Maintain detailed records of modifications for easy analysis and recovery.
  - Support branching and merging for feature development.

### What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges

- **Rapid technological advancement**

  - **Solution:** Adopt continuous learning practices and agile methodologies to stay current.

- **Time constraints**

  - **Solution:** Streamline workflows by dividing projects into manageable sprints.

- **Limited infrastructure**

  - **Solution:** Invest in high-performance tools and efficient data storage architectures.

- **Changing software requirements**

  - **Solution:** Use agile development and modular design for better adaptability.

- **Software security**

  - **Solution:** Implement robust cybersecurity measures like encryption and access control.

- **Software accessibility and usability**

  - **Solution:** Prioritize user-centric design and scalable architecture.

### Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance

- **Unit tests**

  - Test individual methods and functions of classes, components, or modules.
  - Ensure each unit performs its intended function correctly in isolation.

- **Integration tests**

  - Verify that different modules or services work well together.
  - Ensure data flows smoothly between interfaces.

- **System tests**

  - Test the entire software system as a whole.
  - Verify the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Acceptance tests**

  - Confirm the system meets business requirements and end-user needs.
  - Ensure readiness for deployment.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models

- **Prompt engineering** - The process of guiding generative AI solutions to produce desired outputs.
- **Importance:**
  - **Improved user experience** - Helps obtain relevant results efficiently.
  - **Increased flexibility** - Enables domain-neutral instructions for broader adaptability.
  - **Developer control** - Provides clearer context and intent for AI interactions.

### Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise

- **Vague prompt:** Draw a picture of a person.
- **Improved prompt:** Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

**Why the improved prompt is more effective:**

- **Clarity:** Specifies the type of drawing requested.
- **Specific details:** Describes appearance and setting for accurate depiction.
- **Conciseness:** Provides enough detail without overcomplication.
